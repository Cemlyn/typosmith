# Typosmith

A project for analyzing and generating typos using the GitHub Typo Corpus dataset.

## Overview

Typosmith is a project that leverages the [GitHub Typo Corpus](https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus) dataset to:
- Analyze patterns in common typographical errors
- Build models for typo generations

## Dataset Source

This project uses the GitHub Typo Corpus, a large-scale multilingual dataset of misspellings and grammatical errors collected from GitHub commits. The dataset contains:
- Over 350,000 edits
- 65 million characters
- Support for more than 15 languages
- Both misspellings and grammatical errors

The dataset is available at: https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus

## Project Goals

1. **Analysis**: Study patterns in typographical errors across different languages and contexts
2. **Modeling**: Develop models that can generate realistic typos
3. **Applications**: Creation of realistic typos for synthetic training data

This project is licensed under the same terms as the GitHub Typo Corpus dataset.
